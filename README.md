# passwordGenarator

generatePassword()
This function creates a random password based on selected options.

Steps:
Get User Inputs:

Reads length and checkbox states (lowerCase, upperCase, specialCharacters, numbers).

Character Pools:

Defines strings of characters (e.g., abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz).

Builds a combined pool (allChars) based on which boxes are checked.

Also ensures at least one character from each selected type is included in the password.

Build the Password:

Fills the remaining characters randomly from allChars.

Shuffle the Characters:

Uses shuffleArray() to randomize character order (prevents predictable patterns).

Display the Result:

Joins characters and places the result in the password input box.
